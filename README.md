## About The Project

This Specialization covers the fundamentals of iOS application development in the Swift programming language. You’ll learn to use development tools such as XCode, design interfaces and interactions and evaluate their usability, and integrate camera, photo, and location information to enhance your app. In the final Capstone Project, you’ll apply your skills to create a fully-functioning photo editing app for iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. This specialization is divided into 4 courses, each in their own folder, containing the exercises and final projects of the corresponding course.
